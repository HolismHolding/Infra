Engineering maturity levels are:

 - No engineering
 - Intra-project engineering
 - Cross-project engineering
 - Organization-wide engineering
 - Cross-organization engineering
 - Worldwide engineering

If you own multiple companies, your business might require **cross-organization engineering**.   

It means that there can be rules and practices that all companies would follow.

I strongly recommend that you create a well-defined infrastructure, if:

- You own multiple companies
- Some of them are developing software
- Their business lines are similar

This means:

 - Same checklists for
   - Development machines setup (development environments)
   - Project setups
   - CI/CD setup
   - Stating machines setup
   - Production machines setup
 - Same coding styles and guidelines, enforced across your companies
 - A **lean** infrastructure for almost every tech stack you use
